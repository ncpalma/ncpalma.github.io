  <!-- About Me -->
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I hold a Ph.D. in Political Science from <strong>Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile</strong>, and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at <strong>COES – Centro de Estudios de Conflicto y Cohesión Social</strong>. My research focuses on electoral behavior, institutional reforms, and political disaffection, particularly in the Chilean context.</p>

  <p>My doctoral dissertation, titled <em>“Democratic Evolution in Chile: Electoral Reforms, Voter Behavior, and Democratic Satisfaction”</em>, is composed of three articles:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Article 1:</strong> Investigates how voting for the winning option in the 2020 Chilean plebiscite affected satisfaction with democracy. Using panel data and a difference-in-differences approach, it shows that winning increased satisfaction in both the short and long term.</li>
    <li><strong>Article 2:</strong> Analyzes the role of political disaffection and disinterest in voting for outsider candidates in Chile’s 2021 presidential election. It finds that Gabriel Boric, a reformist outsider, attracted disaffected voters more than his populist counterparts.</li>
    <li><strong>Article 3:</strong> Examines the impact of electoral reform and increased district magnitude on voter turnout. The study reveals a U-shaped effect: turnout declined in formerly competitive districts and increased in previously less competitive ones.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>My research explores how institutional and social changes influence electoral participation, voter satisfaction, and democratic legitimacy. I use a mix of quantitative methods, including panel data analysis, difference-in-differences designs, and multinomial logistic regression models applied to original and secondary survey data such as <em>ELSOC</em>.</p>
